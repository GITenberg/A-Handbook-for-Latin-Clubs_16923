<h2>PREFACE</h2>

<p>The Latin Club in secondary schools is the result of the incessant
demand that our Latin instruction must be vivified. Many teachers feel
the need of supplementary work in their Latin teaching, but they have
been handicapped because of a lack of material as well as a lack of
time. This is especially true of the teacher in the small town. To help
meet this demand is the purpose of this book.</p>

<p>The programs have purposely been made too long for one session in
order that the teacher may have some choice in selection, and that, in
case all references are not accessible, enough may be secured to insure
a reasonably varied program.</p>

<p>I would suggest that the Club purchase as many Perry pictures and
Berlin photographs of classical subjects as possible and that its
members coöperate with the city library board for the purchase of such
books as are essential, in case there is no school fund available for
this purpose. Some high school alumnus in whose heart there is
appreciation of Rome's gift to us might present a book to his Alma
Mater. Another might offer some suitable magazines, properly bound.</p>

<p>Of a Latin Club, as of most school work, it may be said that <i>usus
est optimus magister</i>, and especially applicable in this connection
are the words of Horace: <i>Dimidium facti, qui coepit</i>.</p>

"Is not a slave of the same stuff as you, his lord? Does he not enjoy
the same sun, breathe the same air, die, even as you do? Then let your
slave worship rather than dread you. Scorn not any man. The Universe is
the common parent of us all."

<h3>ON AN OLD LATIN TEXT BOOK</h3>

<p>I remember the very day when the schoolmaster gave it to me.... And I
remember that the rather stern and aquiline face of our teacher relaxed
into mildness for a moment. Both we and our books must have looked very
fresh and new to him, though we may all be a little battered now; at
least, my <i>New Latin Tutor</i> is. It is a very precious book, and it
should be robed in choice Turkey morocco, were not the very covers too
much a part of the association to be changed. For between them I
gathered the seed-grain of many harvests of delight; through this low
archway I first looked upon the immeasurable beauty of words....</p>

<p>What liquid words were these: <i>aqua</i>, <i>aura</i>, <i>unda</i>!
All English poetry that I had yet learned by heart&mdash;it is only
children who learn by heart, grown people "commit to memory"&mdash;had
not so awakened the vision of what literature might mean. Thenceforth
all life became ideal....</p>

<p>Then human passion, tender, faithful, immortal, came also by and
beckoned. "But let me die," she said. "Thus, thus it delights me to go
under the shades." Or that infinite tenderness, the stronger even for
its opening moderation of utterance, the last sigh of Aeneas after
Dido,&mdash;</p>

<div class = "verse">
Nec me meminisse pigebit Elissam<br>
Dum memor ipse mihi, dum spiritus hos regit artus....</div>

<p>Or, with more definite and sublime grandeur, the vast forms of Roman
statesmanship appear: "Today, Romans, you behold the commonwealth, the
lives of you all, estates, fortunes, wives and children, and the seat of
this most renowned empire, this most fortunate and beautiful city,
preserved and restored to you by the distinguished love of the immortal
gods, and by my toils, counsels, and dangers."</p>

<p>What great thoughts were found within these pages, what a Roman vigor
was in these maxims! "It is Roman to do and suffer
<span class = "pagenum">67</span>
<a name = "page_67"> </a>
bravely." "It is sweet and glorious to die for one's country." "He that
gives himself up to pleasure, is not worthy the name of a man."...</p>

<p>There was nothing harsh or stern in this book, no cynicism, no
indifference; but it was a flower-garden of lovely out-door allusions, a
gallery of great deeds; and as I have said before, it formed the child's
first real glimpse into the kingdom of words.</p>

<p>I was once asked by a doctor of divinity, who was also the overseer
of a college, whether I ever knew any one to look back with pleasure
upon his early studies in Latin and Greek. It was like being asked if
one looked back with pleasure on summer mornings and evenings. No doubt
those languages, like all others, have fared hard at the hands of
pedants; and there are active boys who hate all study, and others who
love the natural sciences alone. Indeed, it is a hasty assumption, that
the majority of boys hate Latin and Greek. I find that most college
graduates, at least, retain some relish for the memory of such studies,
even if they have utterly lost the power to masticate or digest them.
"Though they speak no Greek, they love the sound on't." Many a
respectable citizen still loves to look at his Horace or Virgil on the
shelf where it has stood undisturbed for a dozen years; he looks, and
thinks that he too lived in Arcadia.... The books link him with culture,
and universities, and the traditions of great scholars.</p>

<p>On some stormy Sunday, he thinks, he will take them down. At length
he tries it; he handles the volume awkwardly, as he does his infant; but
it is something to be able to say that neither book nor baby has been
actually dropped. He likes to know that there is a tie between him and
each of these possessions, though he is willing, it must be owned, to
leave the daily care of each in more familiar hands....</p>

<p>I must honestly say that much of the modern outcry against classical
studies seems to me to be (as in the case of good Dr. Jacob Bigelow) a
frank hostility to literature itself, as the supposed rival of science;
or a willingness (as in Professor Atkinson's
<span class = "pagenum">68</span>
<a name = "page_68"> </a>
case) to tolerate modern literature, while discouraging the study of the
ancient. Both seem to commit the error of drawing their examples of
abuse from England, and applying their warnings to America.... Because
the House of Commons was once said to care more for a false quantity in
Latin verse than in English morals, shall we visit equal indignation on
a House of Representatives that had to send for a classical dictionary
to find out who Thersites was?...</p>

<p>Granted, that foreign systems of education may err by insisting on
the arts of literary structure too much; think what we should lose by
dwelling on them too little! The magic of mere words; the mission of
language; the worth of form as well as of matter; the power to make a
common thought immortal in a phrase, so that your fancy can no more
detach the one from the other than it can separate the soul and body of
a child; it was the veiled half revelation of these things that made

<h3><a name = "page_68b">SAINT AUGUSTINE'S LOVE OF LATIN</a></h3>

<p>Andrew Lang, in his <i>Adventures Among Books</i>, writes:</p>

<p>"Saint Augustine, like Sir Walter Scott at the University of
Edinburgh, was 'The Greek Dunce.' Both of these great men, to their
sorrow and loss, absolutely and totally declined to learn Greek. 'But
what the reason was why I hated the Greek language, while I was taught
it, being a child, I do not yet understand.' The Saint was far from
being alone in that distaste, and he who writes loathed Greek like
poison&mdash;till he came to Homer. Latin the Saint loved, except 'when
reading, writing, and casting of accounts was taught in Latin, which I
held not far less painful

or penal than the very Greek. I wept for Dido's death, who made herself
away with the sword,' he declares, 'and even so, the saying that two and
two makes four was an ungrateful song in mine ears, whereas the wooden
horse full of armed men, the burning of Troy, and the very Ghost of
Creusa, was a most delightful spectacle of vanity.'"</p>

<h3>JUPITER AND HIS CHILDREN</h3>

<h6>A CLASSIC FABLE</h6>

<table summary = "centered poem">
<tr><td>
<div class = "verse">
Once, on sublime Olympus, when<br>
Great Jove, the sire of gods and men,<br>
Was looking down on this our Earth,<br>
And marking the increasing dearth<br>
Of pious deeds and noble lives,<br>
While vice abounds and meanness thrives,&mdash;<br>
He straight determined to efface<br>
At one fell swoop the thankless race<br>
Of human kind. "Go!" said the King<br>
Unto his messenger, "and bring<br>
The vengeful Furies; be it theirs,<br>
Unmindful of their tears and prayers,<br>
These wretches,&mdash;hateful from their birth,&mdash;<br>
To wipe from off the face of earth!"<br>
The message heard, with torch of flame<br>
And reeking sword, Alecto came,<br>
And by the beard of Pluto swore<br>
The human race should be no more!<br>
But Jove, relenting thus to see<br>
The direst of the murderous three,<br>
And hear her menace, bade her go<br>
Back to the murky realms below.<br>
"Be mine the cruel task!" he said,<br>
And, at a word, a bolt he sped,<br>
Which, falling in a desert place,<br>
Left all unhurt the human race!<br>
Grown bold and bolder, wicked men<br>
Wax worse and worse, until again<br>
The stench to high Olympus came,<br>
And all the gods began to blame<br>
The monarch's weak indulgence,&mdash;<i>they</i><br>
<span class = "pagenum">86</span>
<a name = "page_86"> </a>
Would crush the knaves without delay!</div>
<div class = "verse1">
At this, the ruler of the air</div>
<div class = "verse morespace">
Proceeds a tempest to prepare,<br>
Which, dark and dire, he swiftly hurled<br>
In raging fury on the world!<br>
But not where human beings dwell<br>
(So Jove provides) the tempest fell.<br>
And still the sin and wickedness<br>
Of men grew more, instead of less:<br>
Whereat the gods declare, at length,<br>
For thunder bolts of greater strength<br>
Which Vulcan soon, at Jove's command,<br>
Wrought in his forge with dexterous hand.<br>
Now from the smithy's glowing flame<br>
Two different sorts of weapons came:<br>
To <i>hit</i> the mark was one designed;<br>
As sure to <i>miss</i>, the other kind.<br>
The second sort the Thunderer threw,<br>
Which not a human being slew;<br>
But roaring loudly, hurtled wide<br>
On forest-top and mountain-side!</div>

<h6>MORAL</h6>

<h3>BY THE ROMAN ROAD</h3>

<p>"Poetry and paganism do not mix very well nowadays. The Hellenism of
our versifiers is, as a rule, not Greek; it is derived partly from
Swinburne and partly from Pater. But now and then there comes a poet who
has real appreciation of the beauty of classic days; who can express
sincerely and vividly the haunting charm of Greek or Roman culture. Such
an one is the anonymous writer of these lines, which appeared in the
London <i>Punch</i>."</p>

The wind it sang in the pine-tops, it sang like a humming harp;<br>
The smell of the sun on the bracken was wonderful sweet and sharp.<br>
As sharp as the piney needles, as sweet as the gods were good,<br>
For the wind it sung of the old gods, as I came through the wood!<br>
It sung how long ago the Romans made a road,<br>
And the gods came up from Italy and found them an abode.</div>

<div class = "verse morespace">
It sang of the wayside altars (the pine-tops sighed like the surf),<br>
Of little shrines uplifted, of stone and scented turf,<br>
Of youths divine and immortal, of maids as white as the snow<br>
That glimmered among the thickets a mort of years ago!<br>
All in the cool of dawn, all in the twilight gray,<br>
The gods came up from Italy along the Roman way.</div>

<div class = "verse morespace">
The altar smoke it has drifted and faded afar on the hill;<br>
No wood-nymphs haunt the hollows; the reedy pipes are still;<br>
No more the youth Apollo shall walk in his sunshine clear;<br>
No more the maid Diana shall follow the fallow-deer<br>
(The woodmen grew so wise, the woodmen grew so old,<br>
The gods went back to Italy&mdash;or so the story's told!).</div>

<div class = "verse morespace">
But the woods are full of voices and of shy and secret things<br>
The badger down by the brook-side, the flick of a woodcock's wings,<br>
The plump of a falling fir-cone, the pop of the sunripe pods,<br>
And the wind that sings in the pine-tops the song of the ancient
gods&mdash;<br>
The song of the wind that says the Romans made a road,<br>
And the gods came up from Italy and found them an abode!</div>

Echoed from poplar-tree to poplar-tree,<br>

For lost Eurydice.<br>
The Fates walk all alone<br>
In empty kingdoms, where is none to fear<br>
Shaking of any spear.<br>
Even the ghosts are gone<br>
From lightless fields of mint and euphrasy:<br>
There sings no wind in any willow-tree,<br>

Down to the shore where Charon's empty boat,<br>
As shadowed swan doth float,<br>
Rides all as listlessly, with none to steer.<br>

worthy of long life&mdash;nay, of immortality. She had not yet completed
her fourteenth year, and she had already the prudence of an old woman,

sweetness of a girl. How she would cling to her father's neck! how
affectionately and discreetly she would greet us, her father's friends!
how she loved her nurses, her attendants, her teachers,&mdash;everyone
according to his service. How earnestly, how intelligently, she used to
read! How modest was she and restrained in her sports! And with what
self-restraint, what patience&mdash;nay, what courage&mdash;she bore her
last illness! She obeyed the physicians, encouraged her father and
sister, and, when all strength of body had left her, kept herself alive
by the

to us yet more and weightier reasons for our grief and our regret. Oh
the sadness, the bitterness of that death! Oh the cruelty of the time
when we lost her, worse even than the loss itself! She had been
betrothed to a noble youth; the marriage day had been fixed, and we had
been invited. How great a joy changed into how great a sorrow! I cannot

electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be

individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are

copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with

keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.net

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or

License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,

effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO OTHER

work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
